""" zimwriterfs-like tools to convert a build folder into a ZIM

    make_zim_file behaves in a similar way to zimwriterfs and expects the same options:

    - Guesses file mime-type from filenames
    - Add all files to respective namespaces based on mime type
    - Add redirects from a zimwriterfs-compatible redirects TSV
    - Adds common metadata

    Also included:
    - Add redirect from a list of (source, destination, title) strings

    Note: due to the lack of a cancel() method in the libzim itself, it is not possible
    to stop a zim creation process. Should an error occur in your code, a Zim file
    with up-to-that-moment content will be created at destination.

    To prevent this (creating an unwanted Zim file) from happening,
    a workaround is in place. It prevents the libzim from finishing its process.
    While it results in no Zim file being created, it results in the zim temp folder
    to be left on disk and very frequently leads to a segmentation fault at garbage
    collection (on exit mostly).

    Meaning you should exit right after an exception in your code (during zim creation)
    Use workaround_nocancel=False to disable the workaround. """
