"""File extensions to MIME-Type  mapping

All libzim *articles* contains the mime-type of their content, for the libzim
reader to properly return it.

Providing accurate mime-type for ZIM Article is important to prevent broken features
upon reading.
Ex.: youtube scraper uses Web Assembly files (.wasm) for the WebM codecs.
Without the proper mime-type, wasm files are returned as octet-stream and thus
not loaded efficiently.

Should your scraper need additional mapping, use mimetypes.add_type() and it will
be automatically used."""
